<p>Let’s face it, finding the job you want is hard work. Sometimes, you work harder at finding a job than you do on the actual job you land. </p>
<p>Whether you&#39;re looking to reenter the workforce or leave your current position, the excitement of a new career is often thwarted by the daunting task of job searching. Do you really want to sift through job boards to find potential openings, put more time into perfecting your resume, and sit around waiting for the phone to ring?</p>
<p>To make the process easier, consider working with a recruiter. When working with a competent recruiter you&#39;re not totally alone in your job search, and you have a powerful advantage in the marketplace. A recruiter can match you with a job that requires your skills and experiences.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that a recruiter&#39;s job is not to find you a job. Recruiters are hired by businesses looking for employees to fill their open positions. They don&#39;t find jobs for people — they find people for jobs. However, you gain several perks as a job seeker in a recruiter&#39;s candidate pool. Below are seven reasons why you should use a recruiter for your job search.</p>
<p>TRW only works with employers of choice. We have yet to place anyone into a company we would not consider going to ourselves. Some companies we have chosen not to work for because we have not been convinced they are quality environments for employees. We are in this business for the long haul. The last thing we want to have happen is to place candidate in a unsuitable company and then have you call us three months later and ask, “What were you thinking?”
We will marshal all our resources on your behalf. We will meticulously go over your resume with a fine tooth comb. In our minds, a resume is really an employment proposal document that will help the hiring manager to see quickly and easily that you are the person who can solve his problem. What is his problem? He/she either has to meet revenue targets in a specific market space, managing existing business, make his company more efficient or other issues depending on the nature of the position. We will then help you tailor your resume to the specific opportunities we agree to target.
We will also assume responsibility to help you become expert in the interview room. You are not a professional interviewee. If you were, it would make us nervous because we wonder how you got so good—is this all you do? Most candidates believe that a company hires the most qualified person. This is not true. If a candidate gets an interview, he’s qualified; otherwise they wouldn’t be interviewing him/her. So, everyone who interviews is qualified. Thus, the decision to tender an offer is usually made from other criteria than qualifications. We help you identify those and get that offer. Remember, in the recruiting business, there is no prize for second place. It is to our best interest to make certain you win the job.
Because of our relationship with companies, we often we know of positions that are never advertised. If we believe you are a good fit, we will place you in front of the hiring manager and coach you from resume preparation to offer. The worst thing that will happen is that you will have a better resume document and have much better interviewing skills.
We will be straightforward with you, yet tactful. We will act in your best interests. We will get good feedback for you and keep you informed along the way so you know where you stand at all points along the way.</p>
<p>Our goal is to stay with you for the remainder of your career—either placing you with companies or helping you hire the brightest and best.</p>
<p>May we suggest some good reasons to work with a recruiter rather than applying for a job directly?</p>
<ol>
<li>Recruiters save you time.</li>
</ol>
<p>How many hours do you spend searching and sending applications? Did you know that not all open positions are posted on job boards? Some companies only post available jobs on their websites. Others strictly rely on third-party sourcing agencies to find candidates. I’ve had a number of job orders that were confidential; a company was replacing an internal employee and didn’t want that job opening advertised publicly. You could be missing out on opportunities by only relying on job-search websites.</p>
<p>Recruiters can point you towards openings that are hard to find. They can give you access to jobs that are confidentially advertised or not yet posted on the internet. With more options to apply to, you have a better chance of receiving the job offer you want.</p>
<p>By using a recruiter, you split the workload. Recruiters spend eight hours a day (at least) trying to find candidates for their clients.</p>
<p>Recruiters know what jobs are out there. They know you&#39;re out there. And they devote all their time to making sure the right person is linked with the right position.</p>
<p>You have other obligations in life that keep you from job seeking. You might work for your current employer until a new opportunity comes up. You could also be in school or taking care of your family. Using a recruiter saves you time on your job search.
The quickest I’ve ever placed a candidate is one week. I spoke to a candidate for the first time on a Monday and she started her first day of work the following Monday. While that is not the norm, we recruiters can significantly truncate the job search process.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can network on a larger scale.</li>
</ol>
<p>Think of your current job-search connections — past employers, former college professors and administrators, friends, and family. Even if that group is large, it does not match the number that recruiters can reach. Take advantage of a recruiter&#39;s connections to get the most out of your job-seeking efforts.</p>
<p>Recruiters spend a lot of time making connections through databases, phone calls, and face-to-face networking. By using a recruiter during your job search, your network grows exponentially.</p>
<p>When you send a resume to an HR department, you rely on that document to be considered for the job. Even if it’s an excellent resume, it is common for a resume’s first introduction into your dream employer’s realm to actually be processed by an entry-level HR person. These are sharp people, mind you, but not always experienced in the field and therefore not as able to identify winning matches to their open positions just by the content of a resume. </p>
<p>But if a recruiter thinks you are a good fit for their client, you have a hands-on advocate, someone personally in your corner. He actually promotes you to the hiring manager who trusts his/her recommendation. I’ve often had hiring managers tell me, “This candidate doesn’t look that strong on paper, but I trust your opinion. Set up a call.”</p>
<ol>
<li>Recruiters help you through the process.</li>
</ol>
<p>A good recruiter strives to provide the best candidates for their client companies. As part of that process, we then our job-seeking candidates for the entire job placement process, from applying to accepting an offer. If you choose the right recruiter, most of your questions will be answered and real opportunities multiplied.</p>
<p>You can also improve your resume, portfolio, and other applicant documents with the help of a recruiter. They can coach you on interviewing techniques, and, after you interview with the employer, the recruiter can give you feedback from the hiring manager you interviewed with, whether good or bad. </p>
<p>If the feedback is good, you will be progressing in the interview process. If the interview did not have the desired results, a good recruiter will coach you through the reasons and help you to achieve better results next time. Interviewing can be a learned skill, too.</p>
<ol>
<li>Recruiters want to place candidates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cash is king when it comes to who is more driven to get you hired. For recruiters, your acceptance of a job offer means they get a paycheck, so closing a candidate is the name of the game. We recruiters only get paid if you get paid. Typically, our compensation is based on your compensation. The more you make, the more we make. I suppose you could say we’re “properly motivated.” The recruiter’s job is to stack the deck in their candidate’s favor as much as possible because when you do well, we do well. So, we want you to do well. You can and should leverage the recruiter’s motivation to assist you in the job search. </p>
<ol>
<li>Recruiters have someone to follow up with.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you have any idea the low percentage of people who are selected to interview for a job, when only applying online? Why is that? In the first place, you have no idea whether your resume even arrived at the right place. It is likely that there are hundreds of other resumes that come the same way and it’s easy for a resume, digital or paper, to get lost in the shuffle.</p>
<p>The unfortunate thing is that there is no way for you to follow up. In many cases, you don’t even know the name of the person your resume was supposed to be sent to.</p>
<p>Here is where recruiters have a huge advantage. They are talking with the hiring manager personally and can follow up in a day or two regarding next steps. I know great candidates who missed being interviewed because the job was filled the day before. Every day you delay is a day companies have to fill their positions with someone else. Speed is the name of the game.</p>
<ol>
<li>You have an advocate and an advantage.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your recruiter has job orders now and he pretty much knows what the hiring managers are looking for, as well as the general salary range. Without having a recruiter who knows that information firsthand, you can either sell yourself short, or price yourself out of the market. A recruiter also knows where he can push compensation and where he can’t.</p>
<p>A recruiter already has rapport with the hiring manager, which enables him to get honest, straightforward feedback for you. That is critical in the job search. That’s how the recruiter keeps the process moving forward.  </p>
<p>A good recruiter knows what his hiring manger is looking for. He knows how to coach you to speak the language the hiring manager is comfortable with. The difference between language usage in almost-identical companies can be a deal-breaker, if you are saying the same thing a hiring manager is looking for but using proprietary language from another company. A good recruiter has learned to properly translate terms from one company to another.</p>
<p>Even if a decision has been made to pass on you, sometimes it’s just a misunderstanding. A recruiting pro is not opposed to pushing back if he thinks it is warranted. After 21 years of recruiting, I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been able to revive a candidacy after it was pronounced dead. Direct feedback can be critically important. </p>
<ol>
<li>You stay in a database.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if you aren&#39;t hired for the first potential match, you stay in the recruiter&#39;s database. Your resume isn&#39;t tossed if an offer doesn&#39;t pan out immediately. Instead, you&#39;re kept on the recruiter&#39;s radar for future positions.</p>
<p>Though you might think your information will get lost in a huge pool of candidates, that&#39;s not the case. Recruiters use applicant tracking systems that make sorting candidates easy. The software pulls specific information from your resume and matches it to relevant jobs. When the right opening comes along, it&#39;s likely your resume will surface.</p>
