                <p>Our firm uses a thorough and proven process. Initially we contact candidates based on our knowledge of the industry and the reputation of the players. Second, we interview viable candidates for further evaluation based on your criteria. Finally, we select the best three candidates to present to the Client Company.

By the time you meet the candidates, they have visited and are familiar the client’s website, have discussed and considered the pros and cons of the situation and understand the job requirements. In short, the candidate is prepared to accept an offer should one be extended.

Finally, as a third party, we are able to provide clients with candidate feedback and assist in structuring a compensation package acceptable to both client and candidate. We can mediate the terms and specifics between the parties involved creating an effective atmosphere that produces results. Before you ever make a formal offer to a candidate, you will know whether or not it will be accepted. We do not want you to make an offer to a candidate he/she is not prepared to accept. We don’t think that’s good for you or the candidate.</p>
