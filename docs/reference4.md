Originally I met Joe Buonassissi around 2004 when he called out of the blue to recruit me for a seriously challenging global HRHD program for a global Fortune 100 company. He portrayed the business needs of the client honestly and provided me more than enough informaion to make an informed decision - something I appreciate deeply and expect from my business partners. Joe demonstrated his trustworthiness and candor in spades. We were fast friends.

In the ensuing years I've worked with him on several other opportunities, including turning the tables and having him be a recruiter for me when I was with SAP and Cognizant. His candidates were always top drawer, strong and solid performers because Joe did his job of finding out what was important to the practice, the team, the customer, the role and to me. He's an excellent communicator, very personable and likeable, easy to talk to and explain what you need in a candidate Joe finds them. 

The sheer volume of words of esteem cannot express how much I think of Joe and highly recommend him knowing he can do the job.
