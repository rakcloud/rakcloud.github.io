## To Whom It May Concern:

 
I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Joe Buonassissi.  I have worked with Joe since early 2000, as the Chief Operating Officer for I-Sky and had no prior experience or knowledge of Joe prior to that time.  I continue to work with Joe because of the high degree of integrity and the uncompromising values he places in our relationship as well as the relations he forges with the individuals he recommends for placement.  Joe always will do what is right for every party and has demonstrated extreme flexibility, creativity, and common sense in helping match the right talents for key positions.

Each and every person Joe has placed with me has excelled and exceeded our company’s expectations.  It is because of these values and track record that I continue to use Joe and can highly recommend that you give him an opportunity to prove his talents and value; I guarantee that you won’t be disappointed.

Please feel free to contact me if I can answer any questions or be of further assistance, 703-788-5566.

 

Best regards,

Raymond Zukowski

Senior Vice President of Operations
