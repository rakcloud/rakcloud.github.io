Hello Joe,

 
After my conversation with you I told my wife I have never worked with a recruiter with the skills that you possess. I can speak with some authority on this subject when I have spoken to dozens of them when I have tried to hire sales personnel in the past.  Where have you been?

As indicated I have used the same format but have made some changes from the information you provided me. Per our discussion, I have not done this for some time & I included no hyperbole in the document. I respect the fact you are a professional so feel free to be critical. It will not hurt my feelings. I look at it as you are looking out for the both of us. I also have excellent personnel reviews for the last few years. Willing to provide W2's & I have excellent references from previous clients & associates.

Again thank you for your time, interest & consideration.


Jerry
