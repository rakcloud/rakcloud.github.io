# LETTER OF RECOMMENDATION

To Whom It May Concern:

 

I am honored to take this opportunity to discuss the exceptional qualities and outstanding executive placement services provided by Joe Buonassissi whom I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with, placing candidates for me at FutureCall and S.R. Teleperformance for the past eight years, where I held posts as Vice President of Sales.  I continue today to leverage Joe’s recruiting expertise and vast contact center industry knowledge at West. 

While this letter will demonstrate Joe’s professionalism and code of ethics, Mr. Buonassissi’s talents stretch well beyond the commerce of executive recruiting.  Joe sets the bar for others by his thoroughness in understanding the assignment and the personal investment he makes in understanding his client’s needs as well as getting to know candidates before he engages any plan of action.  Each party thoroughly understands the mission and each others objectives before anything is commenced.  Joe’s pre and post placement preparation and execution skills are unique unto himself as I would associate his style to more of a ‘coach’ or a ‘consigliore’ than a recruiter.  One example of this is and what made me immediately take notice of Joe was his willingness to better understand my business and how my service offering was unique from that of my competitors.  By doing this, Joe has put the right candidate in the right role for me, every time.

Joe’s conduct and professionalism are extremely rare and I hope that you will take immediate action and utilize his services for any executive search needs that you might have.  Joe will go the extra mile for you because he is willing to make the investment with each client and understanding your needs first.  In a crowed field Joe Buonassissi stands out. 

If I can be of further assistance please do not hesitate contacting me directly at (402) 963-1314.

 
Best regards,

Chuck Keathley

Director of Sales
