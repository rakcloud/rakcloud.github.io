#### If you are a company in the process of staffing up your organization, please know that...

**TRW** accepts search assignments for Sr. Management Executives, Sales Professionals, Customer Service Managers, IT Professionals and Operations Management in the Business Process Outsourcing and Technology marketplaces.

Doing business since 1998, TRW is aligned with Management Recruiters International (the world’s largest recruiting organization). We have access to more than 4,000 recruiters worldwide. The key to our continuing success is based upon our competitive advantage of a large referral base, specialization, and the leveraging of technology in our own industry.

Once an assignment is accepted, we dedicate the necessary resources and time to successfully complete a client’s search, using all feasible search techniques. Our candidates typically surface from three sources:

1. **Referrals** …we’ve been in the business long enough now (6 years) that often candidates are referred to us without our solicitation…our reputation as a straight shooter has become a real asset.
2. **Database Searches** …using the latest Internet search techniques, we can search nearly 100 databases and post eye-catching ads that attract quality candidates.
3. **Source Companies** …primarily your competitors. Why not hire the brightest stars from companies in your market space? They already know the industry, truncating ramp-up time.

Our firm uses a thorough and proven process. Initially we contact candidates based on our knowledge of the industry and the reputation of the players. Second, we interview viable candidates for further evaluation based on your criteria. Finally, we select the best three candidates to present to the Client Company.

By the time you meet the candidates, they have visited and are familiar the client’s website, have discussed and considered the pros and cons of the situation and understand the job requirements. In short, the candidate is prepared to accept an offer should one be extended.

Finally, as a third party, we are able to provide clients with candidate feedback and assist in structuring a compensation package acceptable to both client and candidate. We can mediate the terms and specifics between the parties involved creating an effective atmosphere that produces results. Before you ever make a formal offer to a candidate, you will know whether or not it will be accepted. We do not want you to make an offer to a candidate he/she is not prepared to accept. We don’t think that’s good for you or the candidate.

Your business success isn’t primarily dependent on the latest management theories, the hottest technological breakthroughs, the best tight-wire budget strategies, the latest acquisitions or the newest sizzling market projections. The Human Element is your organization’s most valuable asset…it is your competitive advantage. Your company will be no better than the people you employ. We help you hire the right people by firing the right questions.

Hire good attitudes, not just good skills. Hire people who want responsibility and are capable of assuming it. Hire service champions who are passionate customer advocates, taking pride in serving customers. To them each customer interaction is an audition. Those are the kinds of people who make a company click.

If we’re on the same page here, let us partner with you to find and attract the best and the brightest. Frankly, we believe that we do what we do best better than anyone else. All we ask is that you let us prove it to you.

#### If you are a candidate looking for a quality company to work for, please know that...

**TRW** only works with employers of choice. We have yet to place anyone into a company we would not consider going to ourselves. Some companies we have chosen not to work for because we have not been convinced they are quality environments for employees. We are in this business for the long haul. The last thing we want to have happen is to place candidate in a unsuitable company and then have you call us three months later and ask, “What were you thinking?”

We will marshal all our resources in your behalf. We will meticulously go over your resume with a fine tooth comb. In our minds, a resume is really an employment proposal document that will help the hiring manager to see quickly and easily that you are the person who can solve his problem. What is his problem? He/she either has to meet revenue targets in a specific market space, managing existing business, make his company more efficient or other issues depending on the nature of the position. We will then help you tailor your resume to the specific opportunities we agree to target.

We will also assume responsibility to help you become expert in the interview room. You are not a professional interviewee. If you were, it would make us nervous because we wonder how you got so good—is this all you do? Most candidates believe that a company hires the most qualified person. This is not true. If a candidate gets an interview, he’s qualified; otherwise they wouldn’t be interviewing him/her. So, everyone who interviews is qualified. Thus, the decision to tender an offer is usually made from other criteria than qualifications. We help you identify those and get that offer. Remember, in the recruiting business, there is no prize for second place. It is to our best interest to make certain you win the job.

Because of our relationship with companies, we often we know of positions that are never advertised. If we believe you are a good fit, we will place you in front of the hiring manager and coach you from resume preparation to offer. The worst thing that will happen is that you will have a better resume document and have much better interviewing skills.

We will be straightforward with you, yet tactful. We will act in your best interests. We will get good feedback for you and keep you informed along the way so you know where you stand at all points along the way.

Our goal is to stay with you for the remainder of your career—either placing you with companies or helping you hire the brightest and best.

If you would like us to partner with you in your job search, please check our job listings and submit your resume for the appropriate postion(s).
